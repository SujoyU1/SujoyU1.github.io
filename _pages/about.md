Welcome to my website! I am a PhD student in Economics at Harvard University.

In June 2018, I graduated from LMU Munich with a B.Sc. in Economics.

I am interested in economic history and political economy. My research focuses on the institutional and ideological consolidation of territorial states, and on the rise of urban economies. A list of research projects can be found [here](research).

My cv can be found [here](files/cv_weigand.pdf).
